# Receipt Splitter (static)

## What it is
A single-page static site that lets you assign each receipt line item to a person (via a dropdown) and shows totals per person.

Selections are saved in your browser using `localStorage`, so they persist after refresh.

## Deploy on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new GitHub repo (public is easiest).
2. Add `index.html` to the repo root and push.
3. In GitHub: **Settings → Pages**
   - Source: `Deploy from a branch`
   - Branch: `main` (or `master`) / root
4. Your page will be available at the GitHub Pages URL shown there.

## Local use
Just open `index.html` in a browser.
